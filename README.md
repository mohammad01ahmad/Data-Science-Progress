# Data Science Progress

Hi! I'm Muhammad Ahmad, a Computer Science student at the University of West London, currently based in the UAE. I'm deeply passionate about Data Science, Machine Learning, and building real-world AI solutions â€” not just theory, but systems that solve problems, drive decisions, and create impact.

Iâ€™ve immersed myself in:

ðŸ“Š Data Analysis & Visualization with Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models using Scikit-learn & TensorFlow

ðŸ”Ž Hands-on Projects â€” including classification models, predictive analytics, and NLP experiments

ðŸ’¡ Constantly learning the mathematics behind ML (linear algebra, statistics, probability)

My GitHub is where I share everything I'm building â€” from academic work to personal deep dives into AI. Whether it's data cleaning pipelines or fine-tuning a transformer model, I aim to write clean, understandable code with a clear focus on why something works.
